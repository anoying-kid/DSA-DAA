# What is algorithm?

- Finite set of steps to solve a problem is called Algorithm.
- Analysis is a process of comparing two algos w.r.t to time, space etc.
    * Prirory : 
        > analysis before execution.
        > it gives approx value.
        > it is independent of machine.

    * Posterior : 
        > analysis after execution.
        > it gives exact value.
        > it is machine dependent.
